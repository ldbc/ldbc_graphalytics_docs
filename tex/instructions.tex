\chapter{Implementation Instructions}
\label{chap:instructions}
Graphalytics provides a set of benchmark software and resources which are open-source and publicly available. This chapter explains how to work with Graphalytics software and enumerates the available benchmark resources which are necessary for the benchmark.



\section{Graphalytics Software and Documentation}\label{sec:instructions:core}
The Graphalytics team develops and maintains the core Graphalytics software, which facilitates the benchmark process and is extendable for benchmarking and analyzing the performance of various graph processing platforms.

\paragraph{Graphalytics Core}
The Graphalytics Core contains the core implementation for the Graphalytics benchmark, provides a programmable interface for platform drivers.
